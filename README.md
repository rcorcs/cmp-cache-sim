# Cache Simulator for Chip Multiprocessors

This project implements a cache simulator for chip multiprocessors
(multi-core processors). Currently, we support both
snooping and directory-based write-invalidate protocols
for cache coherence. The simulator can be used to
evaluate performance with several profiling counters
and different architectural settings.

## Snooping write-invalidate cache coherence protocol

We implement both MSI and MESI snooping protocols.

## Directory-based write-invalidate cache coherence protocol
